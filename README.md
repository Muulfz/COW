# Project COW [![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0%3A0-green)](https://github.com/DasDarki/COW)

> :warning: This Project is in the absolute Alpha. Please report any bugs to the issue page [here](https://github.com/DasDarki/COW/issues). Thanks in advanced!

> :no_entry: Linux isn't built yet and so it is not supported! Please be patient. Linux support will follow soon!

COW stands for **C**Sharp **O**nset **W**rapper and is - as the name says - a Wrapper for the LUA API for Onset Servers.

## Features
  - Create Plugins in .NET Core 3.1 without limitations
  - Cross-Platform compatibility (Windows and Linux are tested)
  - Use the full spectrum of the Server-Side LUA API in C#
  - Load other C# Libraries by simply let it load by the COW Runtime
  - Interact with others C# Plugins or either other LUA Scripts
  - A powerfull API which offers the newest standards
  - No need to interact with C++ or the Runtime itself

## Preview

## Requirements
  - .NET Core =3.1
  - Onset Server
  - One package slot available (keep in mind, there is a package limitation, and COW is an own package)
  - For developers: C# knowledge and NUGET

## Installation
1. Download the latest installer from the release page [here](https://github.com/OnsetCOW/COW/releases)
2. Extract the zip to your server directory
3. To use the installer make sure you have Java 8 or higher 
4. Start the installer by executing the start_installer.bat (on Windows) or the start_installer.sh (on Linux). Mac is not supported.
5. After the installer has been started you have to select the server directory, if the current directory is the server directory, just press enter.
6. Now the installation process starts and is installing COW. Make sure the Server is offline!
7. After installation has been finished you can close the installer and are ready to go.
8. To install COW plugins, just drag them into the *SERVER_DIRECTORY/cow/plugins* folder.

### Getting Started
This is a guide that shows you how to start writing with the COW plugin. We will go through all the steps step by step and explain the absolute basic structure. There will not be a complete tutorial for the complete API, because it is much too big. For more information after this guide, we recommend the documentation of the API itself (see HERE)

#### Step 1: Setup IDE
To use the API you need a .NET Core 3.0 project. We won't go through the steps how to create a project. After the project is created, go to NUGET and search for [Onset](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Onset/) and install the latest version.

#### Step 2: Create Main Class
Now we can create the main class. Every plugin must have a main class. The plugin manager of COW will than use this class as entry point and will manage your plugin from that point. There are some important which are required, so that there are no problemes with the plugin.
First the basic structure:
```csharp
using Onset.Plugin;

namespace TestPlugin
{
    [Meta("test-plugin", 1, "1.0")]
    public class PluginMain : OnsetPlugin
    {
        public override void Load()
        {
            
        }

        public override void Unload()
        {
            
        }
    }
}
```
First of all, the using-declaration. You need to use the namespace **Onset.Plugin**. The main namespace is **Onset**.
Secondly the class must extend OnsetPlugin. Its an abstract class and will force you to override Load and Unload. Load gets called, when your plugin gets loaded and Unload, when it gets unloaded.
Third and also really import, the class must marked with a Meta. The meta defines some important information about your Plugin. The first argument of the meta is the ID of your plugin. Every plugin must have a unique ID. The second is the API version of the current COW API. If the API of one plugin is lower than the current running API, the plugin won't load. Third, the plugin version. You wil need a plugin version, but it won't be a problem, if you fill an empty string.

### Creating Commands
Creating commands with COW is quite simple. When you are coming from the RageMP community, it is just as simple as create commands in this framework.
```csharp
[Command("vehicle")]
public void OnVehicleCommand(IPlayer player, VehicleModel model)
{
     IVehicle vehicle = Server.Global.CreateVehicle(model, player.Position, player.Heading);
     vehicle.Enter(player, 1);
     player.SendMessage("[TestPlugin] Vehicle spawning successful!");
}
```
Mark a method as **Command**, enter a command name, place the **IPlayer** interface to the first argument and place your other parameters behind. They also can be optional. You just need to register the class as command holder class by using
```csharp
Server.RegisterCommands<ClassNameHere>();
```

### Using Server Events
Create a command is simple, using events to. You just need a method and the wanted **EventType**:
```csharp
[ServerEvent(EventType.PlayerJoin)]
public void OnPlayerJoin(IPlayer player)
{
     player.SendMessage("Welcome to this Server!");
}
```
All event types have their own documentation which will inform you which event has which parameters. Now just registering the class as follows:
```csharp
Server.RegisterEvents<ClassNameHere>();
```

### Using Remote Calling
One big part is to call the client-side and take the respond of the request. To call a player's client-side just use
```csharp
player.CallRemote("event-name", "parameters", ...);
```
And taking response by registering the class as holder:
```csharp
Server.RegisterClientEvents<ClassNameHere>();
```
and marking methods as their handler:
```csharp
[RemoteEvent("event-name")]
public void OnEventName(IPlayer player, ...)
{
}
```

### Advanced Topics
#### LUA Interop
LUA Interop or just LUAop stands for LUA interoperating which means you can interact with LUA from C# and vice versa without even to touch C++. Right now it is just a really basic interoping without any returning of data through the layers. But in the future it will be more complex.    
     
To call a C# method from LUA you need to mark the method as lua export.    
```csharp
[LuaExport(Name = "add")]
public void Add(int o1, int o2)
{
    Logger.Debug("Result: " + (o1 + o2));
}
```
The **Name** is optional. If you do not set any name, the method name is the name of the export.     
Now you need to register the function in the interop layer:    
```csharp
LuaInterop.RegisterExports(this);
```
At **this** you need to place the class the lua export method is in.     
     
Now in LUA you can just call it via the COW LUA package. Therefore you need to import the package:
```lua
local cow = ImportPackage("cow_lua")
```
Then just use the executing method to execute the export:
```lua
cow.ExecuteLuaExport("add", 1, 2)
```
And it should work.    
    
**Vice versa**    
The other way around is as simple as the the one way. Register your wanted function as lua import:
```lua
cow.AddLuaImport("someFunction", SomeFunctionInThisLuaFile)
```
and execute it from C# via the interop layer:
```csharp
LuaInterop.Execute("someFunction", "one parameter", "another parameter");
```
